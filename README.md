# capacitor-app

⚡️ Capacitor app template without any dependencies.

This app was created using [`@capacitor/create-app`](https://github.com/ionic-team/create-capacitor-app), and comes with a very minimal shell for building an app.

Simply add the platform you need via the [Capacitor CLI](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/cli):

```bash
npm install @capacitor/<platform>
npx cap add <platform>
```

After that, you can open the native project workspace and launch the app:

```bash
npx cap open <platform>
```

Keep in mind that you need to synchronize the platform once after each change:

```bash
npx cap sync
```
